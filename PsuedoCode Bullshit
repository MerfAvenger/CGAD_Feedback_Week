define screensize x
define screensize y
define tile sizes

create game map 

array [Screensize x/tilesizes, screensize y/tilesizes]

0 = floor
1 = wall
2 = tank
3 = enemy tank
4 = bullet

e.g if map[4,4] = 0, it's a floor
    if map [12, 5] = 3, its the enemy tanks position
    
Useful for:
 
 movement (if keypressed = up
              if array[tank_y, tank_y-1] == 0 #floor
                tank_y++;
               else
                 nothing happens
                 
                 
 drawing (run through array locations and draw sprite corrosponding to tile value)
 
 collision ( see movement)
